Welcome to muSim's documentation!
===================================

muSim/nuSim is a computational framework for predicting motor related
neural activity using recurrent neural newtorks (RNNs) and 
anatomically-accurate musculoskeletal systems. This repo contains modules to train musculoskeletal systems using deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
and RNNs in order to capture the underlying dynamics used by the motor cortex 
to generate movement.

Check out the :doc:`installation` section to install necessary requirements.

Check out the :doc:`usage` for setting up, training, and evaluating the resulting DRL algorithm.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
