Welcome to muSim's documentation!
===================================

muSim/nuSim is a computational framework for predicting motor related
neural activity using recurrent neural newtorks (RNNs) and 
anatomically-accurate musculoskeletal systems. This repo contains modules to train
multiple musculoskeletal systems using deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
and RNNs in order to capture the underlying dynamics used by the motor cortex 
to generate movement.

Check out the :doc:`installation` section to install necessary requirements, and :ref:`usage` 
for setting up, training, and evaluating the resulting DRL algorithm.
